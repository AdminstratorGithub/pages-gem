Once the `github-pages` gem is installed, you can build your site using `jekyll build`, or preview your site using `jekyll serve`.*\r\n\r\n## Updating\r\n\r\nTo update to the latest version of Jekyll and associated dependencies, simply run `gem update github-pages`, or if you've installed via Bundler, `bundle update github-pages`.\r\n\r\n## Project Goals\r\n\r\nThe goal of the GitHub Pages gem is to help GitHub Pages users bootstrap and maintain a Jekyll build environment that most closely matches the GitHub pages build environment. The GitHub Pages gem relies on explicit requirements shared between both users' computers and the build servers to ensure that the result of a user's local build is consistently also the result of the server's build.\r\n\r\nAdditional tools, such as tools that integrate with the GitHub API to make managing GitHub Pages sites easier are not the primary goal, but may be within the project's scope.\r\n\r\n## What's versioned\r\n\r\nThe GitHub Pages gem seeks to version two aspects of the build environment:\r\n\r\n### 1. Ruby\r\n\r\nThe version of Ruby with which Jekyll is executed. Although Jekyll itself may be compatible with prior or future versions of Ruby, different execution environments yield different results. Ruby 1.8.7 parses YML differently than 1.9.3, for example, and Kramdown has trouble processing `mailto` links prior to 1.9.3. In order to ensure that building locally consistently results in the same build as what appears when published, it's essential that Ruby itself is versioned along side the Gem, despite no known incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n### 2. Dependencies\r\n\r\nThis includes Markdown processors, and any other Jekyll dependency for which version incongruency may produce unexpected results. Traditionally, MaruKu, Kramdown, RedCloth, liquid, rdiscount, and redcarpet have been strictly maintained due to known breaking changes.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nSee [all releases](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/releases).\r\n\r\n## Releasing\r\n\r\nTo release a new version of this gem, run `script/release` from the `master` branch.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nDistributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
